# Offcue

Offcue is a crossâ€‘platform reminder and scheduling app built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and React Native. The project uses the Expo Router for navigation and provides a customizable notification system for recurring reminders.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development client**

   - **iOS**
     ```bash
     npm run ios
     ```
   - **Android**
     ```bash
     npm run android
     ```

   Both commands launch the Expo development build in the respective simulator or emulator.

3. **Optional: start Expo without building**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
